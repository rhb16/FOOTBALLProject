The Football Club Player Selection Application is designed to help the club's administration select 10 players based on their playing positions and produce various reports. The application collects player details such as their first and last names, agility and power test (APT) and strength and endurance test (SET) scores, position on the field (defender, midfielder, attacker), and the national association (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, or Wales) to which they currently belong.
